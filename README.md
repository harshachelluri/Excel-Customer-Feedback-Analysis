## Steps to Solve the Business Problem

### 1. Define Goals
- **Primary Goal:**  
  Identify trends in customer feedback to address common concerns and improve satisfaction.
  
- **Secondary Goal:**  
  Understand how product categories, brands, and price points impact customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### 2. Gather Data
- **Data Required:**
  - Customer feedback, ratings, and NPS scores.
  - Product details (category, brand, price).
  - Feedback channels (website, in-store, etc.).
  - Customer demographics (gender, region, etc.).

- **Simulated Dataset:**
  - Columns:
    - `ID`, `Full Name`, `Gender`, `Checkout Date`, `Source`, `NPS Rating`, `Feedback Category`, `Rating`, `Product Name`, `Category`, `Brand`, `Price`, `Availability`.

---

### 3. Data Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, especially in `Feedback` and `Rating` columns.
   - Standardize textual data (e.g., convert "Pos" to "Positive").
   - Categorize ratings into "Low", "Medium", and "High" based on numerical ranges.

2. **Identify Key Metrics:**
   - **Average NPS Score:** To gauge overall customer loyalty.
   - **Percentage of Positive Feedback:** To measure satisfaction trends.
   - **Average Ratings by Category/Brand:** To identify top-performing products and areas for improvement.

3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Analyze feedback over time to detect seasonal or trend-specific patterns.
   - Study correlations between product price and customer satisfaction.

### 4. Visualize Insights (Using Excel)
1. **Create an Excel Dashboard with the Following:**
   - **KPIs:**
     - Average NPS Score.
     - Percentage of Positive vs. Negative Feedback.
     - Top 3 Products by Rating.
  
   - **Charts:**
     - **Bar Chart** for NPS Distribution (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
     - **Pie Chart** for Feedback Categories (e.g., product quality, service, delivery).
     - **Line Chart** for Rating Trends over time.
     - **Column Chart** for Average Ratings by Product Category.
  
   - **Interactive Filters:**
     - Use Slicers for Source, Date, and Product Category to filter the data dynamically.

---

### 5. Business Recommendations
- **For Low NPS Scores:**
  - Identify common complaints (e.g., delivery delays, product defects) and address them directly.
  - Prioritize operational improvements, such as shipping times or product quality.

- **For High-Performing Products:**
  - Replicate the successful strategies (e.g., marketing, product features, pricing) across other categories.

- **For Negative Feedback Trends:**
  - Provide training to staff to address recurring service issues.
  - Review pricing or availability for low-rated products to enhance their appeal.

---

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Improved Customer Satisfaction:**  
   Resolve at least 80% of common complaints and improve overall satisfaction.
  
2. **Enhanced Product/Service Quality:**  
   Focus on underperforming products/categories with low ratings and improve them.

3. **Actionable Insights:**  
   Provide clear recommendations to the marketing and product teams for improving customer retention and satisfaction.
